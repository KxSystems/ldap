# LDAP interface for KDB+
[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/kxsystems/ldap?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/kxsystems/ldap/releases) [![Travis (.org) branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/kxsystems/ldap/master?label=travis%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/kxsystems/ldap/branches)

## Introduction

This interface allows KDB+ to interact with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This API permits a client to authenticate & search against an LDAP server. The interface is a thin wrapper against the open source OpenLDAP library. General info on this API is available [here](https://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap&sektion=3&apropos=0&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release).

## Documentation

Documentation outlining the functionality available for this interface can be found [here](https://code.kx.com/q/interfaces/ldap). (*URL NOT CURRENT OPERATIONAL - SEE CODE.KX.COM SECTION BELOW*)

## New to LDAP?

General information is available [here](https://ldap.com/). 

## Running 

### Download

Download the latest release from our [releases page](https://github.com/KxSystems/ldap/releases)

### Installation

#### Linux

Prior to using this interface, the openldap library package should be installed (e.g. redhat releases may include openldap package by default), which includes libldap.so. The latest openldap can also be build & installed from source, by obtaining the latest release from [here](https://openldap.org/).

To install this kdb ldap library and scripts, either

- run the provided install.sh

or

- copy `kdbldap.so` which was built or downloaded earlier to your kdb+ folder. If on a Linux 64bit machine with kdb+ installed in `/usr/local/q`, place the shared library into `/usr/local/q/l64/`.
- the q script to load the solace API (`ldap.q`) can be placed in the current working directory or within the kdb+ install directory.

#### Windows

TODO - openldap install

To install the library and scripts, either

- run the provided install.bat

or

- copy `kdbldap.dll` which was built or downloaded earlier, to your kdb+ install binary dir e.g. if kdb+ installed at `C:\q`, place the shared library into `C:\q\w64\`.
- copy the q script to load the solace API (`ldap.q`) can be placed in the current working directory or within the kdb+ install directory.

#### Mac

TODO - openldap install

To install the library and scripts, either

- run the provided install.sh

or

- Copy `kdbldap.so` which was built or downloaded earlier, to your kdb+ install binary dir e.g. if kdb+ installed at `/usr/local/q`, place the shared library into `/usr/local/q/m64/`..
- The q script to load the solace API (`ldap.q`) can be placed in the current working directory or within the kdb+ install directory.

## Building Interface From Source

### Linux

#### Linux OpenLdap Builds

The latest release of OpenLdap is referenced [here](https://www.openldap.org/software/release/)

For example, the 2.4.50 release is available in source form from [here](https://www.openldap.org/software//download/OpenLDAP/openldap-release/openldap-2.4.50.tgz )

To build/install, unzip the downloaded source and run

```
./configure --disable-slapd --with-tls=openssl
 make
 make install
```

#### Building Linux Interface

After unstalling OpenLdap, to create a build within the build directory run the following:

```
cd build
cmake ../
make install
```

You should then find the resulting files in a newly created api dir, which should reside within the build directory.

### Windows

#### Windows OpenLdap Builds

Pre-built OpenLdap Windows libraries can be retrieved using pacman package manager (supplied with msys2). The package is [mingw-w64-x86_64-openldap](https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-openldap). Example instruction for install

```
# update database of packages
pacman -Fy
# search for openldap package name
pacman -Ss openldap
# list contents of package prior to install
pacman -Fl <x64 package name found in prev search>
# install package
pacman -S <x64 package name found in prev search>
```

##### Converting msys2 provided libldap.dll to libldap.lib for use with Visual Studio

Use the provided dll2lib.bat to convert liblber.dll and libldap.dll (found in the mingw64/bin dir of your msys2 install).

```
dll2lib.bat liblber.dll
dll2lib.bat libldap.dll
```

Move the resulting liblber.lib and libldap.lib to the mingw64/lib dir of your msys2 install.

### Building Windows Interface

##### Example build command using Visual Studio 2019

Open 'x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019' as supplied with Visual Studio.

Go to the downloaded source & enter the build directory. Run the following builds commands

```
set BUILD_HOME=<dir containing lib and include directory of the openldap library>
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ..
MSBuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj /m /nologo /verbosity:normal /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

Created libs/etc can then be found in the newly created kdbldap dir

### Mac

#### Mac OpenLdap Builds

The [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) install manager provides a installation of OpenLdap. Once HomeBrew is available on your mac, run the following to install OpenLdap

`brew install openldap`

#### Building Mac Interface

Building the interface from source requires `gcc`, `gcc c++`, `make` and `cmake` packages installed on your development machine (e.g. xcode for Mac).

Follow these steps

1. Install OpenLdap (see above)
2. Set an environment variable `BUILD_HOME` to the location on the installed OpenLdap
3. Run `cmake`
4. Run `make install`

For example, on Linux/Mac, to create a build within the build directory

```
export BUILD_HOME=/usr/local/opt/openldap/
cd build
cmake ../
make install
```

You should then find the resulting files in a newly created api dir, which should reside within the build directory.

## Overview

[kxsystems/ldap](https://github.com/KxSystems/ldap)

LDAP is a vendor neutral protocol to gain interaction with directory services. The open protocol that client/servers should implement is detailed on [RFC 4511](https://docs.ldap.com/specs/rfc4511.txt).

The protocol is often used by organizations for centralized authentication and storage of their resources such as users, groups, services, applications, etc. For example, a client application can find if a user is a member of a particular group to allow access to their service.

The KDB+ interface for LDAP uses [OpenLDAP](https://openldap.org/), which has client libraries and server implementations.  Not all server vendors may provide the same set of features, so this API aims to be vendor neutral to gain maximum flexibility.

## Function Reference

### .ldap.init

Initializes the session with LDAP server connection details. Connection will occur on first operation. Does not create a connection. Use unbind to free the session. Reference [ldap_initialize](https://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap_init&sektion=3&apropos=0&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release)

Syntax: `.ldap.init[sess;uris]`

Where

- sess is an int/long that you will use to track the session in subsequent calls. Should be a unique number for each session you wish to initialize. The number can only be reused to refer to a session after a .ldap.unbind.
- uris is a symbol list. Each URI in the list must follow the format of schema://host:port , where schema is 'ldap','ldaps','ldapi', or 'cldap'.

Returns 0 if successful.

### .ldap.setOption

Sets options per session that affect LDAP operating procedures. Reference [ldap_set_option](https://www.openldap.org/software/man.cgi?query=ldap_set_option&sektion=3&apropos=0&manpath=OpenLDAP+2.4-Release)

Syntax: `.ldap.setOption[sess;option;value]`

Where

- sess is an int/long that represents the session previously created via .ldap.init
- option is a symbol for the option you wish to set. See supported options below.

### .ldap.setGlobalOption

Sets options globally that affect LDAP operating procedures. LDAP handles inherit their default settings from the global options in       effect at the time the handle is created (i.e. if a global setting is made, all sessions initialized after that will inherit those settings but not any sessions created prior). Reference .ldap.setOption for params & details.

### .ldap.getGlobalOption

Gets options globally that affect LDAP operating procedures. Reference .ldap.getOption for details and parameter details

Syntax: `.ldap.getGlobalOption[option]`

### .ldap.bind_s

Synchronous bind operations are used to authenticate clients (and the users or applications behind them) to the directory server, to establish an authorization identity that will be used for subsequent operations processed on that connection, and to specify the LDAP protocol version that the client will use. See [here](https://ldap.com/the-ldap-bind-operation/) for reference documentation

Syntax: `.ldap.bind_s[sess;dn;cred;mech]`

Where

- sess is an int/long that represents the session previously created via .ldap.init
- dn is a string/symbol. The DN of the user to authenticate. This should be empty for anonymous simple authentication, and is typically empty for SASL authentication because most SASL mechanisms identify the target account in the encoded credentials. It must be non-empty for non-anonymous simple authentication.
- cred is a char/byte array or symbol. LDAP credentials (e.g. password). Pass empty string/symbol when no password required for connection.
- mech is a string/symbol. Pass an empty string to use the default LDAP_SASL_SIMPLE mechanism. Query the attribute 'supportedSASLMechanisms' from the  server's rootDSE for the list of SASL mechanisms the server supports.

Returns a dict consisting of 

- ReturnCode - integer. See error code reference  within this document.
- Credentials - byte array which is the credentials returned by the server. Contents are empty for LDAP_SASL_SIMPLE, though for other SASL mechanisms, the credentials may need to be used with other security related functions (which may be external to LDAP). Reference documentation for your security mechanism.

#### Using Security Mechanisms

LDAP supports a range of security mechanisms as part of the bind call. Check with your LDAP server/admin what is supported (often found in the root attribute named 'supportedSASLMechanisms').

Most of the security mechanisms are performed externally, in separate code related to your security mechanism.

For example,  DIGEST_MD5 is initially performed by calling bind with no credentials, mech set to "DIGEST-MD5" & capturing the returned credential values from the server. Using the returned credentials to MD5 encode the user details, a second bind call is then made with the MD5 encoded details as the 'cred' parameter. This requires an additional MD5 library that is outside the scope of this interface (Ref: [example code)](https://github.com/zheolong/melody-lib/blob/master/libldap5/sources/ldap/common/digest_md5.c). Other security mechanisms may operate in a similar manner (e.g. [GSSAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Security_Services_Application_Program_Interface) example [here](https://github.com/hajuuk/R7000/blob/master/ap/gpl/samba-3.0.13/source/libads/sasl.c), [CRAM-MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAM-MD5) available [here](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/master/usr/src/lib/libldap5/sources/ldap/common/cram_md5.c)).

### .ldap.search_s

Synchronous search for partial or complete copies of entries based on a search criteria.

Syntax: .ldap.search_s[sess;baseDn;scope;filter;attrs;attrsOnly;timeLimit;sizeLimit]

Where

- sess is an int/long that represents the session previously created via .ldap.init
- baseDn is a string/symbol. The base of the subtree to search from. An empty string/symbol can be used to search from the root (or when a DN is not known).
- scope  is an int/long. Can be set to one of the following values:
  - 0 (LDAP_SCOPE_BASE) Only the entry specified will be considered in the search & no subordinates used
  - 1 (LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL) Only search the immediate children of entry specified. Will not use the entry specified or further subordinates from the children.
  - 2 (LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE) To search the entry and all subordinates
  - 3 (LDAP_SCOPE_CHILDREN) To search all of the subordinates
- filter is a string/symbol. The filter to be applied to the search ([reference](https://ldap.com/ldap-filters/))
- attrs is a symbol list. The set of attributes to include in the result. If a specific set of attribute descriptions are listed, then only those attributes should be included in matching entries. The special value “*” indicates that all user attributes should be included in matching entries. The special value “+” indicates that all operational attributes should be included in matching entries. The special value “1.1” indicates that no attributes should be included in matching entries. Some servers may also support the ability to use the “@” symbol followed by an object class name (e.g., “@inetOrgPerson”) to request all attributes associated with that object class. If the set of attributes to request is empty, then the server should behave as if the value “*” was specified to request that all user attributes be included in entries that are returned.
- attrsOnly is an int/long. Should be set to a non-zero value if only attribute descriptions are wanted. It should be set to zero (0) if both attributes descriptions and attribute values are wanted.
- timeLimit is an int/long. Max number of microseconds to wait for a result. 0 represents no limit. Note that the server may impose its own limit.
- sizeLimit is an int/long. Max number of entries to use in the result. 0 represents no limit. Note that the server may impose its own limit.

Returns a dict consisting of 

- ReturnCode - integer. See error code reference within this document
- Entries - table consisting of DNs and Attributes. Attribute forms a dictionary, were each attribute may contain one or more values.
- Referrals - list of strings providing the referrals that can be searched to gain access to the required info (if server supports referrals)

### .ldap.unbind_s

Synchronous unbind from the directory, terminate the current association, and free resources. Should be called even if a session did not bind (or failed to bind), but initialized its session.

Syntax: `.ldap.unbind_s[sess]`

Where 

- sess is an int/long that represents the session previously created via .ldap.init. The number should not longer be used unless .ldap.init and .ldap.bind_s has been used to create a new session.

### .ldap.err2string

Returns a string description of an LDAP error code. The error codes are negative for an API error, 0 for success, and positive for a LDAP result code

Syntax: `.ldap.err2string[err]`

Where 

- err is an ldap error code (see error code reference  within this document)

## Error Code Reference

The function .ldap.err2string call can provide a string representation of the error code.

0 = Success

### Protocol Codes

These are all positive values. Reference IANA registered result codes [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ldap-parameters/ldap-parameters.xhtml#ldap-parameters-6)

### API Error Codes

These are all negative values.
